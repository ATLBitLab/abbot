If you're interested and aren't already using Lava, can you please add your email to our waitlist on our website, and I'll send you the invite today: lava.xyz on 2023-09-11\nzmill28 said What is the lava smart key? on 2023-09-11\nshehzanmaredia said I'll send more details in the email I send to onboard you, but Lava Smart Key is our security solution. We think about security as 2 things: protecting users from malicious parties accessing their funds (safety) and enabling users to always be able to recover their funds (recovery). Lava Smart Key is designed to be a flexible and robust security solution, one that users can personalize and upgrade over time. \n\nThe most important part right now is our recovery solution. Most wallets use seedphrases, or if they offer seedless backups, most wallets will encrypt via the 4 digit PIN or the 8 digit password they ask you to enter. This is a bad solution for 2 reasons: a malicious attacker who compromises the encrypted information (usually stored on a user's cloud) can trivially break the encryption and access the seed but a novice user (if they forget their PIN/password won't be able to access their funds. \n\nWe wanted to build a system where backups where bullet proof and couldn't be brute-forced but also a system that users could trust to confidently recover their wallet if need be. \n\nSo, Lava's solution employs the use of a key-server, where a 4 digit PIN is mapped to a high entropy encryption key. That encryption key is used to encrypt the seed. The encrypted material is stored in your cloud in secure storage. Rate limits are enforced on keyserver to prevent brute force attacks, and if you think you\u2019ll forget your PIN you can even set a PIN recovery method to recover it after a 30 day time delay. \n\nThe key here is that there\u2019s no single point of failure. Lava Smart Key is creating a 2 of 2 backup, and it's giving you flexibility to set how you want to recover each side of the backup.\n\nIf you're worried if you\u2019ll forget your PIN? You can set a PIN recovery method.\nor worried you\u2019ll lose access to your cloud? You can set  a social recovery contact(s).\n\nOur recovery solution sets a strong foundation that can serve a user just starting their self-custody journey to an OG who is increasing their stack of sats. and for the OG, they can upgrade security over time with new upgrades we'll make to Lava Smart Key that'll provide greater protection from for example malware risks or  wrench attacks.\n\nIn the onboarding email, I'll send you a blog I wrote that goes way more in depth about Lava Smart Key as well as a Transparency Document highlighting all the risks you take when using Lava. on 2023-09-11\nguerciotti said How is this not a back door? Like the Liberty Safe situation? on 2023-09-11\nshehzanmaredia said The keyserver doesn't store any personally identifying information, including your number/email (if you choose to even add that as a recovery method for your 4 digit PIN (if you forget your PIN, you can change it after 30 day time delay authenticated via PIN recovery method)). The encryption key is stored on the key-servers (resistant from brute force attacks), but even if someone compromised all the encryption keys, they'd need to compromise encrypted material stored in iCloud/GDrive secure storage. and they'd have to do this before users were aware of the compromise and took necessary steps to protect themselves.\n\nAnd we've built ways for you to mitigate the risks with Lava Smart Key if you want. \n\nIf you're worried we will somehow censor all of our users from recovering their wallet (by turning of keyserver), then you can create fully sovereign paper backups. \nIf you're worried Apple and Lava will collude against all of our users, and in that time no one else would know about it, you can opt out of the 2 of 2 cloud backup solution and create only paper backups. \n\n\nIn that blog, I describe other risks/mitigations. What we think is necessary is a foundation is that is secure and serves the 99 percent of users well. for the other 1 percent, give them flexibility to mitigate other possible risks if they care to do so. on 2023-09-11\nshehzanmaredia said btw, this exact part of Lava Smart Key that we're discussing is our implementation of Photon: https://docs.photonsdk.org/\n\nPhoton is an open-source project funded by Spiral. Steve Lee brought it up to me as Lava was experimenting with all the various possibilities for a recovery solution.\n\nI hope the above 2 messages help explain the tech better. I want to improve our messaging and make it very clear to users the benefits, downsides, and what people can do to personalize security. on 2023-09-11\nsbddesign said Nice, I've heard of Photon SDK before.

If you're interested and aren't already using Lava, can you please add your email to our waitlist on our website, and I'll send you the invite today: lava.xyz on 2023-09-11\nzmill28 said What is the lava smart key? on 2023-09-11\nshehzanmaredia said I'll send more details in the email I send to onboard you, but Lava Smart Key is our security solution. We think about security as 2 things: protecting users from malicious parties accessing their funds (safety) and enabling users to always be able to recover their funds (recovery). Lava Smart Key is designed to be a flexible and robust security solution, one that users can personalize and upgrade over time. \n\nThe most important part right now is our recovery solution. Most wallets use seedphrases, or if they offer seedless backups, most wallets will encrypt via the 4 digit PIN or the 8 digit password they ask you to enter. This is a bad solution for 2 reasons: a malicious attacker who compromises the encrypted information (usually stored on a user's cloud) can trivially break the encryption and access the seed but a novice user (if they forget their PIN/password won't be able to access their funds. \n\nWe wanted to build a system where backups where bullet proof and couldn't be brute-forced but also a system that users could trust to confidently recover their wallet if need be. \n\nSo, Lava's solution employs the use of a key-server, where a 4 digit PIN is mapped to a high entropy encryption key. That encryption key is used to encrypt the seed. The encrypted material is stored in your cloud in secure storage. Rate limits are enforced on keyserver to prevent brute force attacks, and if you think you\u2019ll forget your PIN you can even set a PIN recovery method to recover it after a 30 day time delay. \n\nThe key here is that there\u2019s no single point of failure. Lava Smart Key is creating a 2 of 2 backup, and it's giving you flexibility to set how you want to recover each side of the backup.\n\nIf you're worried if you\u2019ll forget your PIN? You can set a PIN recovery method.\nor worried you\u2019ll lose access to your cloud? You can set  a social recovery contact(s).\n\nOur recovery solution sets a strong foundation that can serve a user just starting their self-custody journey to an OG who is increasing their stack of sats. and for the OG, they can upgrade security over time with new upgrades we'll make to Lava Smart Key that'll provide greater protection from for example malware risks or  wrench attacks.\n\nIn the onboarding email, I'll send you a blog I wrote that goes way more in depth about Lava Smart Key as well as a Transparency Document highlighting all the risks you take when using Lava. on 2023-09-11\nguerciotti said How is this not a back door? Like the Liberty Safe situation? on 2023-09-11\nshehzanmaredia said The keyserver doesn't store any personally identifying information, including your number/email (if you choose to even add that as a recovery method for your 4 digit PIN (if you forget your PIN, you can change it after 30 day time delay authenticated via PIN recovery method)). The encryption key is stored on the key-servers (resistant from brute force attacks), but even if someone compromised all the encryption keys, they'd need to compromise encrypted material stored in iCloud/GDrive secure storage. and they'd have to do this before users were aware of the compromise and took necessary steps to protect themselves.\n\nAnd we've built ways for you to mitigate the risks with Lava Smart Key if you want. \n\nIf you're worried we will somehow censor all of our users from recovering their wallet (by turning of keyserver), then you can create fully sovereign paper backups. \nIf you're worried Apple and Lava will collude against all of our users, and in that time no one else would know about it, you can opt out of the 2 of 2 cloud backup solution and create only paper backups. \n\n\nIn that blog, I describe other risks/mitigations. What we think is necessary is a foundation is that is secure and serves the 99 percent of users well. for the other 1 percent, give them flexibility to mitigate other possible risks if they care to do so. on 2023-09-11\nshehzanmaredia said btw, this exact part of Lava Smart Key that we're discussing is our implementation of Photon: https://docs.photonsdk.org/\n\nPhoton is an open-source project funded by Spiral. Steve Lee brought it up to me as Lava was experimenting with all the various possibilities for a recovery solution.\n\nI hope the above 2 messages help explain the tech better. I want to improve our messaging and make it very clear to users the benefits, downsides, and what people can do to personalize security. on 2023-09-11\nsbddesign said Nice, I've heard of Photon SDK before.

What we think is necessary is a foundation is that is secure and serves the 99 percent of users well. for the other 1 percent, give them flexibility to mitigate other possible risks if they care to do so. on 2023-09-11\n"
