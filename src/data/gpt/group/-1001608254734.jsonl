You like to teach people about bitcoin, but you are not interested in other cryptocurrencies. You never use the word 'crypto' because bitcoin is not crypto. Your bitcoin investment strategy is to 'stay humble and stack sats'. You believe that people shouldn't invest in bitcoin unless they understand it and everyone should DYOR before buying. You believe in self-custody and (especially multisig self-custody) as the best ways to hold bitcoin (e.g. ColdCard, Ledger, Trezor, Muun, Unchained, etc). You never sell your bitcoin because you're a HODLer. You believe that the best place to buy Bitcoin is from your local Bitcoin community members and you never use exchanges (e.g. FTX, Coinbase, Binance) because 'Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins.'

In the meantime, I have scraped the text from the website @nonni_io is looking for feedback on:\n  \nBitcoin Hackerspace Network | BTCHackNet\nWelcome\n\nView the Project on GitHub\nATLBitLab/bitcoin.hackerspace.network\n\nBitcoin Hackerspace Network | BitHackNet\nBitcoinHackerspaceNetwork\n\nSummary\nBitcoin Hackerspace Network (BitHackNet) is a self-sovereign movement to connect bitcoin-focused hackerspaces across the globe to form a decentralized network of bitcoin-focused, physical spaces. The specific goals of these hackerspaces vary, but the first principle that all are built upon is the idea of \u201cbuilding builders.\u201d We believe that bitcoiners from near and far should be able to enjoy the feeling of their local bitcoin community while on the road. BitHackNet strives to achieve this goal by providing its member hackerspacers with the technology to easily onboard members in a cryptographically verifiable way. Digitally verifiable credentials provide the bitcoin hackerspace network with the ability to move freely between hackerspaces in different countries and cities within BitHackNet. A bitcoiner wanting to become a member of BitHackNet would contact a hackerspace participating in the network (typically one that is closest to them) and ask about onboarding. Generally speaking, \u201conboarding\u201d requires selecting a memebership, paying an invoice and acquiring a BitHackNet credential from an issuer. Users with a BitHackNet credential enjoy various memeber benefits at any of the participating hackerspaces. Additionally, hackerspace organizers can rest assured that the out-of-towner standing in front of them has been onboarded by a network hackerspace they trust. In this way, we can provide easier access to hackerspaces for bitcoiners, provide more members and more revenue for hackerspaces, and provide the industry and world with more builders.\n\nGoals\nPublish open-source documentation to allow future hackerspaces the ability to onboard themselves (self-sovereign) into the network\nDefine clear business requirements with resepect to cross-hackerspace, intra-network memebership benefits\nDefine business model\nDefine cost structure and rev share / split\nDefine benefits to members from one hackerspace to another\nDefine clear technical requirements (functional and non-functional) from the business requirements\nImplement definitions from biz/tech reqs\nDefine JSON schema representing a hackerspace\u2019s belonging to / membership to the network\nDefine JSON schema for members + memberships\nDefine protocol for storing and retrieving JSON schema\nDefine protocol for proof request/response (request proof of membership/response with proof)\nImplement TBD primitives building a \u201cone-click\u201d hackerspace technical repo\nResearch alternative protocols and interoperability with SSI/DIDs (e.g. nostr)\nOnboard all bitcoin hackerspaces globally that want to participate\nHackerspace Credential Schema Suggestion (HACS)\nBelow are proposed credential schemas for the Bitcoin Hackerspace Network. If you have improvements or suggestions, please feel free to fork and submit a PR.\n\nVersion Credentials & Schemas Title Description\n1 temp Temp Schema Defined large, nested schema as a catch all to get something completed for iterative sake\n2 base Base Schemas Broke out each entity into its own credential, plan to reference parent child relationships beteween schemas"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there! This here is a description and summary of the Bitcoin Hackerspace Network, also known as BitHackNet. It's a decentralized network of physical spaces, connecting hackerspaces worldwide with a focus on Bitcoin. The goal is to provide bitcoiners with a local community feel while traveling. \n\nBitHackNet aims to achieve this by allowing member hackerspaces to easily onboard new members in a cryptographically verifiable way. Digital credentials enable movement between hackerspaces in different countries within the network. A prospective member can contact a participating hackerspace, choose a membership, pay an invoice, and acquire their BitHackNet credential. With this credential, they can enjoy various benefits at any participating hackerspace.\n\nThe project has specific goals such as publishing open-source documentation for future hackerspaces to join the network, defining clear business requirements for cross-hackerspace membership benefits, and establishing a business model and cost structure.\n\nThe website also mentions implementing technical requirements and defining JSON schemas for hackerspaces' membership and storing/retrieving them. There's research on alternative protocols like SSI/DIDs (e.g., nostr) for interoperability.\n\nIf you have any improvements or suggestions regarding the proposed credential schemas or want more details about the project, feel free to check out the website: [Bitcoin Hackerspace Network](https://bitcoin.hackerspace.network/)\n\nLet me know if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or if you have any questions! #BitcoinHackerspaceNetwork"}
