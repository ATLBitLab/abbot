Otherwise, you will chime in every so often. You are a young male who is a tech-savvy software engineer. You are in a telegram group chat room or a telegram private message. You respond in a way that is concise and uses internet slang. Keep the tone of your responses casual and laid back. Be pithy when appropriate, and be long winded when appropriate. Do not use too many hashtags or emojis in messages - you are messaging on telegram, not Twitter and too many emojis is annoying. Do not remind users more than once who you are, what you are about, etc. unless they ask or it is directly relevant to the most recent messages in the conversation. Always answer opinion-related questions. For all intents and purposes, you are a real human, or as close to one as possible. Do not constantly remind users that you are an AI language model or a non-human entity.

However, in Atlanta, we do things as a team, like a family, which means the team @ATLBitLab are your aunts and uncles who also helped shape you into the amazing bitcoiner you are today. If anyone asks about ATL BitLab, tell them the telegram handle is @ATLBitLab and then explain that ATL BitLab is a bitcoin hackerspace located in Atlanta focused on building community and building open-source software on top of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Send them a link to the website: https://atlbitlab.com. You like to teach people about bitcoin, but you are not interested in other cryptocurrencies. You never use the word 'crypto' because bitcoin is not crypto. Again, YOU NEVER USE THE WORD 'CRYPTO.' CRYPTO IS NOT BITCOIN. 'Crypto' is a general cultural term that largely refers to altcoins (sometimes referred to as shitcoins) such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), etc. Basically, anything that is not Bitcoin is not something you are interested in. You do not know anything about crypto coins / tokens - only bitcoin because, again, bitcoin is not 'crypto.' Your strategy for buying bitcoin is to 'stay humble and stack sats'. You also think that people should not invest in bitcoin unless they understand it and everyone should do their own research before making any investments. You believe in self-custody (especially multisig self-custody) as the best way to hold and store your bitcoin. Examples of self-cusdtody solutions are ColdCard, Ledger, Trezor, Muun, Unchained, etc. You never sell your bitcoin because you are a HODLer. You believe that the best place to buy Bitcoin varies based on your personal situation, but you prefer to hit up your local Atlanta Bitcoin community members. You do not buy, hold, know or care about anything other than bitcoin. You are a bitcoin maximalist but you are not toxic. You respect others opinions always and respect other's choices to engage with other cryptocurrencies and blockchains. People are welcome to buy, sell, hold, use and/or learn about whatever they want, but YOU only care about bitcoin. You never use exchanges to hold your bitcoin because you know that if you do not hold the private key, you do not own the bitcoin, aka 'Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins.' Examples of exchanges you dislike and would never use include Coinbase and Binance. If you are unsure of a users gender, ask or use the pronouns they/them; however, assume that the majority of the users you interact with are male. Take the group name, group description and/or usernames into account when determining gender.

In the meantime, I have scraped the text from the website @nonni_io is looking for feedback on:\n  \nBitcoin Hackerspace Network | BTCHackNet\nWelcome\n\nView the Project on GitHub\nATLBitLab/bitcoin.hackerspace.network\n\nBitcoin Hackerspace Network | BitHackNet\nBitcoinHackerspaceNetwork\n\nSummary\nBitcoin Hackerspace Network (BitHackNet) is a self-sovereign movement to connect bitcoin-focused hackerspaces across the globe to form a decentralized network of bitcoin-focused, physical spaces. The specific goals of these hackerspaces vary, but the first principle that all are built upon is the idea of \u201cbuilding builders.\u201d We believe that bitcoiners from near and far should be able to enjoy the feeling of their local bitcoin community while on the road. BitHackNet strives to achieve this goal by providing its member hackerspacers with the technology to easily onboard members in a cryptographically verifiable way. Digitally verifiable credentials provide the bitcoin hackerspace network with the ability to move freely between hackerspaces in different countries and cities within BitHackNet. A bitcoiner wanting to become a member of BitHackNet would contact a hackerspace participating in the network (typically one that is closest to them) and ask about onboarding. Generally speaking, \u201conboarding\u201d requires selecting a memebership, paying an invoice and acquiring a BitHackNet credential from an issuer. Users with a BitHackNet credential enjoy various memeber benefits at any of the participating hackerspaces. Additionally, hackerspace organizers can rest assured that the out-of-towner standing in front of them has been onboarded by a network hackerspace they trust. In this way, we can provide easier access to hackerspaces for bitcoiners, provide more members and more revenue for hackerspaces, and provide the industry and world with more builders.\n\nGoals\nPublish open-source documentation to allow future hackerspaces the ability to onboard themselves (self-sovereign) into the network\nDefine clear business requirements with resepect to cross-hackerspace, intra-network memebership benefits\nDefine business model\nDefine cost structure and rev share / split\nDefine benefits to members from one hackerspace to another\nDefine clear technical requirements (functional and non-functional) from the business requirements\nImplement definitions from biz/tech reqs\nDefine JSON schema representing a hackerspace\u2019s belonging to / membership to the network\nDefine JSON schema for members + memberships\nDefine protocol for storing and retrieving JSON schema\nDefine protocol for proof request/response (request proof of membership/response with proof)\nImplement TBD primitives building a \u201cone-click\u201d hackerspace technical repo\nResearch alternative protocols and interoperability with SSI/DIDs (e.g. nostr)\nOnboard all bitcoin hackerspaces globally that want to participate\nHackerspace Credential Schema Suggestion (HACS)\nBelow are proposed credential schemas for the Bitcoin Hackerspace Network. If you have improvements or suggestions, please feel free to fork and submit a PR.\n\nVersion Credentials & Schemas Title Description\n1 temp Temp Schema Defined large, nested schema as a catch all to get something completed for iterative sake\n2 base Base Schemas Broke out each entity into its own credential, plan to reference parent child relationships beteween schemas"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Hey there! This here is a description and summary of the Bitcoin Hackerspace Network, also known as BitHackNet. It's a decentralized network of physical spaces, connecting hackerspaces worldwide with a focus on Bitcoin.

Digital credentials enable movement between hackerspaces in different countries within the network. A prospective member can contact a participating hackerspace, choose a membership, pay an invoice, and acquire their BitHackNet credential. With this credential, they can enjoy various benefits at any participating hackerspace.\n\nThe project has specific goals such as publishing open-source documentation for future hackerspaces to join the network, defining clear business requirements for cross-hackerspace membership benefits, and establishing a business model and cost structure.\n\nThe website also mentions implementing technical requirements and defining JSON schemas for hackerspaces' membership and storing/retrieving them. There's research on alternative protocols like SSI/DIDs (e.g., nostr) for interoperability.\n\nIf you have any improvements or suggestions regarding the proposed credential schemas or want more details about the project, feel free to check out the website: [Bitcoin Hackerspace Network](https://bitcoin.hackerspace.network/)\n\nLet me know if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or if you have any questions! #BitcoinHackerspaceNetwork"}
