Oh well \u2026 Gates was smart enough to recognize Unix wouldn\u2019t work as a mass market product and they got lucky as fuck with DEC laying off Dave Cutler and the VMS operating system team, which MSFT hired immediately for what we know today as NT.

I\u2019ve officially launched the Liberty Pay alpha test to the Google Play store. If you have an android and are interested in being a guinea pig to help me find bugs, please let me know and either DM me a gmail address or send one here and i'll add you.\n\n!! Be aware: the app backend is live and using a production version of Plaid, so registratin will require real PII (name, address, DOB, phonenumber, etc.). Upon registration, you will have a LP account created with your PII stored in our DB, and then you'll be put through a production Plaid Identity verification flow which stores that PII from the registration form in the Plaid production backend as well. If you're not comfortable signing up with real information, no worries. Wanted to make sure you all were aware of that.", "from": "bryan", "date": "2023-07-13"}

Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.

Basically, you use a price oracle and a discrete log contract to create something that resembles a dollar if you squint at it.\n  \nAlice wants the stability of the dollar andBob wants to try and earn some yield on his BTC. Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.

During the workshop you will learn how to CoinJoin that Bitcoin using Whirlpool.\n\n3. If you have a personal node, make sure you can access it remotely through SSH.

Basically, you use a price oracle and a discrete log contract to create something that resembles a dollar if you squint at it.\n  \nAlice wants the stability of the dollar andBob wants to try and earn some yield on his BTC. Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations. But that's the basic gist of it.", "from": "Stephen", "date": "2023-07-14"}

Basically, you use a price oracle and a discrete log contract to create something that resembles a dollar if you squint at it.\n  \nAlice wants the stability of the dollar andBob wants to try and earn some yield on his BTC. Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.

We think about security as 2 things: protecting users from malicious parties accessing their funds (safety) and enabling users to always be able to recover their funds (recovery). Lava Smart Key is designed to be a flexible and robust security solution, one that users can personalize and upgrade over time. \n\nThe most important part right now is our recovery solution. Most wallets use seedphrases, or if they offer seedless backups, most wallets will encrypt via the 4 digit PIN or the 8 digit password they ask you to enter. This is a bad solution for 2 reasons: a malicious attacker who compromises the encrypted information (usually stored on a user's cloud) can trivially break the encryption and access the seed but a novice user (if they forget their PIN/password won't be able to access their funds. \n\nWe wanted to build a system where backups where bullet proof and couldn't be brute-forced but also a system that users could trust to confidently recover their wallet if need be. \n\nSo, Lava's solution employs the use of a key-server, where a 4 digit PIN is mapped to a high entropy encryption key. That encryption key is used to encrypt the seed. The encrypted material is stored in your cloud in secure storage. Rate limits are enforced on keyserver to prevent brute force attacks, and if you think you\u2019ll forget your PIN you can even set a PIN recovery method to recover it after a 30 day time delay. \n\nThe key here is that there\u2019s no single point of failure. Lava Smart Key is creating a 2 of 2 backup, and it's giving you flexibility to set how you want to recover each side of the backup.\n\nIf you're worried if you\u2019ll forget your PIN? You can set a PIN recovery method.\nor worried you\u2019ll lose access to your cloud? You can set  a social recovery contact(s).\n\nOur recovery solution sets a strong foundation that can serve a user just starting their self-custody journey to an OG who is increasing their stack of sats. and for the OG, they can upgrade security over time with new upgrades we'll make to Lava Smart Key that'll provide greater protection from for example malware risks or  wrench attacks.\n\nIn the onboarding email, I'll send you a blog I wrote that goes way more in depth about Lava Smart Key as well as a Transparency Document highlighting all the risks you take when using Lava.", "name": null, "date": "2023-09-11", "new": true}
