{"text": "Good morning ATL BitDevs! Just wanted to make a reminder that TAB Conf is coming up in September, and this year, all content (talks, workshops, builder day tables, etc) is OPEN SOURCE. What does that mean? It means TAB continues to lean into its community-led, grassroots style by letting the plebs build the schedule. If you want to talk about something at TAB, go to the github repo, and use one of the templates to submit content. The org team is actively vetting all submissions from now until Setpember, and as we get closer, they will be selecting the talks that get the most engagement on GH (i.e. emojis, comments, etc). https://twitter.com/tabconf/status/1666824544039108611\n\nAlso, don\u2019t sleep on getting your ticket for CHEAP.

Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.

{"text": "It's one of those topics I typically start rambling sometime after the 2nd beer. Basically, you use a price oracle and a discrete log contract to create something that resembles a dollar if you squint at it.\n  \nAlice wants the stability of the dollar andBob wants to try and earn some yield on his BTC. Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.
