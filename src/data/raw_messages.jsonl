Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.

In other words, would all of the world\u2019s resources/ \u201cthe value of the world economy\u201d add up to roughly 21 million bitcoin? I understand value is subjective and assets would still fluctuate in price over/under-evaluation so I know it wouldn\u2019t be perfectly 21 million but am curious if this is still a \u201crelatively\u201d fair thing to say to explain bitcoin to normies? (And for semantics, let\u2019s assume that all 21 million bitcoin have been mined and can be used (i.e. none have been \u201clost\u201d)).\n\n(I ask bc I\u2019m writing and article on inflation/money and wanted to add some tidbits ab bitcoin.)

Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.

Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, what's the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations.

Two years later, the bond rally he\u2019s overseeing is proving too lucrative to resist.\n\nEye-popping 70% returns \u2014 the best among dollar bonds from emerging markets this year \u2014 are attracting investors who were once cautious or avoiding the securities altogether. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed Income are among those who have recommended or bought the debt, betting it will continue climbing.\n\n\u201cAlthough we missed a significant share of the rally, we still think there\u2019s value across El Salvador\u2019s curve,\u201d JPMorgan research strategists Ben Ramsey, Nishant Poojary and Gorka Lalaguna wrote in a July note, moving overweight on the debt. \u201cThere\u2019s room for this credit to keep outperforming.\u201d\n\nThe optimism demonstrates how Bukele has gained acceptance from both money managers and his peers in Latin America after many had dismissed him as an anti-establishment maverick. His hard-line stance on gangs, which has dramatically cut crime in the country, is influencing politics throughout the region. And his commitment to paying bondholders is making him a favorite among emerging-market investors.\n\nSource \ud83d\udd17", "group_chat_created": false, "entities": [{"length": 2, "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/bitcoin-touting-bukele-s-bond-rally-draws-jpmorgan-eaton-vance?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter", "type": "text_link", "offset": 8}, {"length": 34, "url": "https://t.me/tupireport/13687", "type": "text_link", "offset": 13}, {"length": 60, "type": "bold", "offset": 212}, {"length": 111, "type": "italic", "offset": 509}, {"length": 55, "type": "italic", "offset": 751}, {"length": 30, "url": "https://t.me/tupireport/13917", "type": "text_link", "offset": 985}, {"length": 48, "url": "https://t.me/tupireport/13641", "type": "text_link", "offset": 1016}, {"length": 43, "url": "https://t.me/tupireport/13593", "type": "text_link", "offset": 1068}, {"length": 56, "type": "bold", "offset": 1153}, {"length": 9, "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-15/bitcoin-touting-bukele-s-bond-rally-draws-jpmorgan-eaton-vance?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter", "type": "text_link", "offset": 1212}], "message_id": 10462, "delete_chat_photo": false, "date": "2023-08-16T22:58:23+00:00", "supergroup_chat_created": false, "channel_chat_created": false, "from": "guerciotti", "new": true, "name": "guerciotti"}

His hard-line stance on gangs, which has dramatically cut crime in the country, is influencing politics throughout the region.
