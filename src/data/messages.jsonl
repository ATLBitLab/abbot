{"text": "Good morning ATL BitDevs! Just wanted to make a reminder that TAB Conf is coming up in September, and this year, all content (talks, workshops, builder day tables, etc) is OPEN SOURCE. What does that mean? It means TAB continues to lean into its community-led, grassroots style by letting the plebs build the schedule. If you want to talk about something at TAB, go to the github repo, and use one of the templates to submit content. The org team is actively vetting all submissions from now until Setpember, and as we get closer, they will be selecting the talks that get the most engagement on GH (i.e. emojis, comments, etc). https://twitter.com/tabconf/status/1666824544039108611\n\nAlso, don\u2019t sleep on getting your ticket for CHEAP.
