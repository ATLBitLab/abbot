Just wanted to make a reminder that TAB Conf is coming up in September, and this year, all content (talks, workshops, builder day tables, etc) is OPEN SOURCE. What does that mean? It means TAB continues to lean into its community-led, grassroots style by letting the plebs build the schedule. If you want to talk about something at TAB, go to the github repo, and use one of the templates to submit content. The org team is actively vetting all submissions from now until Setpember, and as we get closer, they will be selecting the talks that get the most engagement on GH (i.e. emojis, comments, etc). https://twitter.com/tabconf/status/1666824544039108611\nbryan: Good morning ATL BitDevs!

Hopefully it's opened sourced, air gapped, allows for your own entropy to be used for seed generation, let's you use your own node and also supports P2PKH addresses / message singing. Otherwise I'll likely be sticking with coldcard. IMO minimizing your OPSEC sphere of trust in the bitcoin environment is always be top priority and so far combining coldcard and my own node with PSBTs seems to be the best approach in doing so.\n"]}
