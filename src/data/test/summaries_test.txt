Text: For those that are not in the know.... It's not looking good for PrimeTrust. Recommend moving funds into cold storage if currently custodied by PT on an affiliated app. Many Bitcoin only apps use PT. Swan Bitcoin moved off as of last week. Not sure what I am allowed to say regarding Strike, but Jack will be making an announcement soon. We notified users that we were moving off PT last month as well. BitGo is insured up to 250 mil per account for cold storage on their platform. Don't know how much I can say, but Strike was preparing for this and has taken the necessary steps to protect it's users funds... üëç I would recommend withdrawing Bitcoin from any custodial platform, per usual tho.

Alex responded on 2023-06-09 20:53:38 with "lol, I'm paying him". On 2023-06-09 20:54:52, Alex mentioned it wasn't a liquidity issue and on 2023-06-09 20:55:09, Stephen suggested it had more to do with triggering the payout. On 2023-06-09 20:55:29, Nitesh suggested Alex wrote rarted JS and on 2023-06-09 20:56:10, Nitesh joked about it. On 2023-06-09 20:56:31, Alex thought it was given.

On 2023-06-09 21:00:54, Alex mentioned making the payment wasn't the hard part and on 2023-06-09 21:01:10, Alex mentioned it was scheduling it to run in the future iff no one else pays within the window. On 2023-06-09 21:01:32, Nitesh asked if lnngest was easier. On 2023-06-09 21:02:04, Alex mentioned he'd DM more details. On 2023-06-09 21:07:14, Nitesh joked and on 2023-06-09 21:07:22, Stephen mentioned paying the 40k from his Zeus. On 2023-06-09 21:07:26, Stephen mentioned Alex owing him.

Text: Good morning ATL BitDevs! Just wanted to make a reminder that TAB Conf is coming up in September, and this year, all content (talks, workshops, builder day tables, etc) is OPEN SOURCE. What does that mean? It means TAB continues to lean into its community-led, grassroots style by letting the plebs build the schedule. If you want to talk about something at TAB, go to the github repo, and use one of the templates to submit content. The org team is actively vetting all submissions from now until Setpember, and as we get closer, they will be selecting the talks that get the most engagement on GH (i.e. emojis, comments, etc). Also, don‚Äôt sleep on getting your ticket for CHEAP. Hands down the strongest singal conference with the most accessible price point in the industry IMHO. Only $221 right now.

Text: Good morning ATL BitDevs! Just wanted to make a reminder that TAB Conf is coming up in September, and this year, all content (talks, workshops, builder day tables, etc) is OPEN SOURCE. What does that mean? It means TAB continues to lean into its community-led, grassroots style by letting the plebs build the schedule. If you want to talk about something at TAB, go to the github repo, and use one of the templates to submit content. The org team is actively vetting all submissions from now until Setpember, and as we get closer, they will be selecting the talks that get the most engagement on GH (i.e. emojis, comments, etc). Also, don‚Äôt sleep on getting your ticket for CHEAP. Hands down the strongest singal conference with the most accessible price point in the industry IMHO. Only $221 right now.

Text: For those of you wondering about how many seminars Chaincode runs in a year, I asked Adam Jonas, who said ‚Äú3-4 [seminars] in a year. We run them once we have enough demand so more applicants mean we will run them more often.‚Äù If you‚Äôre interested in participating in a seminar, I encourage you to go apply here: https://chaincode.applytojob.com/apply/9I75v7voVu/Chaincode-Labs-Bitcoin-Protocol-Development-Seminar-Virtual. Feel free to contact me if you need help with the application process. How cool would it be if we had a bunch of BITliens in the next chaincode seminar!!
