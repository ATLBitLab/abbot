Which is a really remarkable design because it’s scaled from 1mb early days to ~1.6Tbits ATM

Strike Infrastructure Update: We Now Serve Customers on Our Own Infrastructure https://jimmymow.medium.com/strike-infrastructure-update-we-now-serve-customers-on-our-own-infrastructure-366922c47cc2
[2023-06-08 22:17:50] Citizen 🇺🇸: Here’s a link for MVCC from last night, the internal database checkpointing system used by Oracle and PostgreSQL, etc.

To put things in perspective, UCB Prof & entrepreneur Michael Stonebraker was at the forefront of these developments. Postgres is so named because the first academic db research project called Ingress had already begun commercialization, so they were exceedingly creative in their next name. 🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤣🤦🏻‍♂️

All this development and research was nearly contemporaneous with the development of TCP/IP and the BSD versions of Unix. Which begat the Unix Wars and which prompted the development of “Unix compatible” Linux.

No Unix Wars, no Linux. Try to imagine that 🤷🏻‍♂️

Heck, MicroSoft was an early leader in Unix systems via their Xenix platform. Oh well … Gates was smart enough to recognize Unix wouldn’t work as a mass market product and they got lucky as fuck with DEC laying off Dave Cutler and the VMS operating system team, which MSFT hired immediately for what we know today as NT. Boom 💥

Strike Infrastructure Update: We Now Serve Customers on Our Own Infrastructure https://jimmymow.medium.com/strike-infrastructure-update-we-now-serve-customers-on-our-own-infrastructure-366922c47cc2
[2023-06-08 22:17:50] Citizen 🇺🇸: Here’s a link for MVCC from last night, the internal database checkpointing system used by Oracle and PostgreSQL, etc.

To put things in perspective, UCB Prof & entrepreneur Michael Stonebraker was at the forefront of these developments. Postgres is so named because the first academic db research project called Ingress had already begun commercialization, so they were exceedingly creative in their next name. 🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤣🤦🏻‍♂️

All this development and research was nearly contemporaneous with the development of TCP/IP and the BSD versions of Unix. Which begat the Unix Wars and which prompted the development of “Unix compatible” Linux.

No Unix Wars, no Linux. Try to imagine that 🤷🏻‍♂️

Heck, MicroSoft was an early leader in Unix systems via their Xenix platform. Oh well … Gates was smart enough to recognize Unix wouldn’t work as a mass market product and they got lucky as fuck with DEC laying off Dave Cutler and the VMS operating system team, which MSFT hired immediately for what we know today as NT.

Podcasting has its roots within the early blogging community, specifically Dave Winer(sp?) of Userland software and inventor of the RSS feed.
