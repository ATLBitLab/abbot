Powered by DLCs?\n\nIf anyone knows what that means, would probably be a good presentation topic. on 2023-07-14\nStephen said Its one of those topics I typically start rambling sometime after the 2nd beer. Basically, you use a price oracle and a discrete log contract to create something that resembles a dollar if you squint at it.\n  \nAlice wants the stability of the dollar andBob wants to try and earn some yield on his BTC. Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1.\n  \nThere are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, whats the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations. But thats the basic gist of it. on 2023-07-14\nCitizen \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 said Ok, umm \u2026 hmm, interesting \ud83e\udd14 \n\nSo, to summarize, I basically owe you two beers \ud83c\udf7b \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude44 on 2023-07-14\nbryan said Hey everyone!

In other words, would all of the world\u2019s resources/ \u201cthe value of the world economy\u201d add up to roughly 21 million bitcoin? I understand value is subjective and assets would still fluctuate in price over/under-evaluation so I know it wouldn\u2019t be perfectly 21 million but am curious if this is still a \u201crelatively\u201d fair thing to say to explain bitcoin to normies? (And for semantics, let\u2019s assume that all 21 million bitcoin have been mined and can be used (i.e. none have been \u201clost\u201d)).\n\n(I ask bc I\u2019m writing and article on inflation/money and wanted to add some tidbits ab bitcoin.) I appreciate any help! on 2023-07-17\nStephen said Thats an interesting thought experiment. I dont know if Id call it an \"IOU\", but it does seem correct to say that if its the only currency used, you then own one millionth of the worlds *purchasing power*. I dont think its accurate to say that its worth one millionth of world resources. For example, imagine jewelry composed of gold and precious stones that has been passed down through the family for generations. It might fetch a fair amount of bitcoin on the open market, but if its precious family heirloom, then its not for sale. Im sure one could think of other examples of resource that. effectively aren;t for sale. So IMHO, more accurate to think in terms of purchasing power rather than actual claims to resources. on 2023-07-17\nStephen said Thats an interesting thought experiment.

And yeah, I agree, when you get to nitty gritty of subjective value bc, in theory, there are some things that people wouldn\u2019t sell for all of the money in the world.\n\nI\u2019m just trying to think of a more concrete way of explaining the idea to people. Bc saying \u201cyou own one millionth of the world\u2019s purchasing power\u201d still is an abstract idea and not as concrete. Like it\u2019s hard for people who know literally nothing about money to understand what that means. Any thoughts on a more concrete way to explain it? I can still work it in if not, but just getting something more tangible/concrete that people understand would help. on 2023-07-17\n", "2023-07-18": "Summarize the key points in this text.

You can\u2019t take the energy in your body right now with you ten years into the future, nor the present moment, so you trade those for something you can. That lends itself to introducing salability across time & salability across space as definitions, then Coincidence of wants, then path dependence from SoV to MoE to UoA\u2026 then there\u2019s a framework in place to assess Bitcoin against other monetized assets.
