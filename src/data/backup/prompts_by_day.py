But I visited a bitcoin mining site today. Considering Bitcoin is digital gold I can say now that I enjoyed the digital gold mining site at Cleanspark. Having worked in a Data Centres space for 1.5 yrs, it all looked very familiar to me and made sense. \nThanks Stephen for putting so much of your time and effort from your daily job to make it possible for all the ATL bitcoin community to experience digital gold mining. on 2023-08-10\naidalop21 said Yessss.
