{"2023-08-23": "sbddesign said In the bustling city of Atlanta, the esteemed members of the BitPlebs Society shall reconvene at the venerable Manuels Tavern on the twenty-third day of August. They shall indulge in sumptuous fare, refreshing libations, and engage in spirited discourse upon the topic of Bitcoin.\n\nIt is foreseen that our conversation shall be punctuated with recent happenings and primarily directed towards the much-anticipated Halving of the Bitcoin in the early days of 2024. One might say, the populace remains quite unprepared for the forthcoming events!\n\nWhile the majority amongst us harbour intentions of procuring their own sustenance and spirits from dear Manuels, those who venture to make an early appearance shall be graced with complimentary beverages.\n  \nhttps://www.meetup.com/atlanta-bitplebs/events/295475406/ on 2023-08-23\n"}
