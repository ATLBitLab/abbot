Do you need some other limits set?\nRobert: It would need to have a definable window, allow changing of the vote until the end of the window and a simple enough interface to allow for on the fly polling. We are libertarians, at our last business meeting we had nine resolutions to fix oxford commas. Then spent hours debating the religious implications to membership of what day we held the business meeting on.\nRobert: Looking at the repository for it now thx!\nRobert: Quite a bit of anything is simply knowing what is already available.\n", "Mike: That's why in order to do it right you have to download the source and generate on an airgapped device.  Before HD keys, this was pretty much the only way to do analog cold storage.\n\nIf done properly they are extremely trustworthy, if a bit outmoded.\nMike: There was also one generator that was bought out by scammers and turned into a honeypot, this has given paper wallets a bad rep.\n\nIn the early days you had problems with lost funds because people didn't understand how change addresses work and wallets weren't mature.\nbryan: Personally, I would just roll some dice \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f but that\u2019s just me\nbryan: Personally, I would never ever use an online entropy generator.

That\u2019s what the conventional definition of a paper wallet is.\nbryan: But the original question was in reference to a \u201cpaper key \u2026 [and] what manufacturers would you all trust\u201d\nbryan: And my answer for that was \u201cnone\u201d\nRobert: Actually the original q was intended to be about cold wallets w/ manufacturers you do You would trust and paper keys.

Manufacturers you trust\nbryan: \ud83e\udd16 \ud83e\udd52\nRobert: We are looking at a silent auction and at least some of it will be BTC only.\nMike: Personally I like Trezor, Jade seems very good, but I don't own one.\nRobert: So we need a way to allow people to get BTC and bid with it in the easiest quickest way possible. One idea was to make all delegates a paper wallet let them add funds during the convention to bid, and introduce them to BTC economy... Like a prepaid debit card\nRobert: Of course this violates the idea of a true private key, but I trust myself to not rip off 100 gun toating delegates\nRobert: Toting even...\nMike: Interesting.  So is the idea that whatever is put on the wallets is spent in short order to cast a vote?\nRobert: Use a sat to cast your vote. Also bid in the auction\nMike: Rereading... You want them to spend it buying something\nMike: I would recommend paper wallets for this.\nMike: They cost nothing and are easy to create in bulk.\nMike: People should never store anything on a wallet they didn't generate themselves, but if you are handing it out it's a different story\nRobert: And I have a true entropic generator\u2026 a cesium pig I use for one-time pas implementations\nRobert: Pad...\nRobert: I can load them with 100 Sats each at creation that's what about a quarter? Plenty of them for voting\nMike: Maybe.... Depends on fees.\nRobert: If they want to buy something that is BTC only they can use their own wallet or temp add funds to a paper wallet. For the 2-day event.\n", "Mike: If you are going to generate, I recommend downloading the source of Bit address.org: https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org\n\nYou can run it in an offline computer and specify your own privkeys, I believe.\nRobert: What we want is to expose as many of our people to BTC trading economics, tanstaafl, and voting and such\nMike: Just be careful, if fees happen to be high, the example could backfire.\nRobert: Tanstaafl being one of our platforms.. There ain't no such a thing as a free lunch\nRobert: Can we run our own lighting node with a 0 fee for 48 hours or such? Maybe we roll our own currency for 72 hours or such.

Easiest way I\u2019ve seen to give SATs over LN.\nbryan: This is how @sbddesign and I have given away bitcoin at events https://lightsats.com/\nbryan: It\u2019s custodial but if it\u2019s small amounts of bitcoin being given out at an event, self custody is less of a concern. You can embed the link to the SATs in a QR.\nbryan: Another good option (albeit a little more costly) is a SATs card https://satscard.com/\nbryan: Physical card for self custody with 10 \u201cslots\u201d for loading and unloading bitcoin.\nRobert: eXComm member just suggested we have them donate to the party in say $20 blocks and any unused Sats become a \u201cdonation\u201d I don't like that idea as much, but it's a possibility\n", "packetprotector: One NFC tag for the lightning wallet download.

It was been proven that these holes function as pinhole cameras that focus moon-based mind control rays\nRobert: Err can\u2019t\nMichael: Is this written by Luke?\nStephen: Another angle to consider is this whole concept of gifting a paper wallet to somebody. Even supposing you generate the keys from a reliable source, once you've written them down, the person you are gifting it to doesn't have a reliable way of knowing who has and has not seen that piece of paper. Which might be fine for a smaller amount of bitcoin or a friend who trusts you, but it's not really the foundation for a scalable solution. But, it's easy. These things all have different trade-offs.\nMichael: Afaik I haven't heard of anyone getting their hot Bitcoin stolen off their LN node. Something interesting to think about. These computers that allow inbound connections on Internet connected devices seem to be doing a decent job at securing funds (at least to do far to some extent). I think there's btc core devs that just just a Bitcoin core wallet node but use it for nothing else but the node itself. @nonni_io\nRobert: The expected lifespan of the paper wallet is 72 hours\nStephen: If you want to have bitcoin as a prize for stuff, services liek Lightsats are nice. They custody small amounts of bitcoin and you give the person a redeem link. Lightsats helps them finds a bitcoin wallet and then withdraw the funds so the person can self-custody. If the peson fails to withdraw their bitcoin in let's say 2 months, you get your bitcoin back. https://lightsats.com\nMichael: Dude this is the old legend post lol I forgot about this\n\n\nThis is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground.
