Stephen said On Wednesday night, we're going to be looking at the leaked Google memo "We Have No Moat" that @ClockworkKat shared with us. This is an interesting piece because it really shows how powerful open source AI models are becoming. What does this have to do with bitcoin? Well, a hackathon kicked off this past weekend called AI 4 ALL. The goal of this hackathon is to integrate bitcoin/lightning with AI applications. As such, I thought this article would be a great discussion piece to get the creative juices flowing for participating in such an event.

Summary for 2023-07-14:
Stephen said Mutiny Wallet was released from beta and opened to the world yesterday. Its pretty neat so far! https://www.mutinywallet.com/ 

Citizen 🇺🇸 said Synthetic USD? Powered by DLCs?

Stephen said Its one of those topics I typically start rambling sometime after the 2nd beer. Basically, you use a price oracle and a discrete log contract to create something that resembles a dollar if you squint at it. Alice wants the stability of the dollar and Bob wants to try and earn some yield on his BTC. Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together. Alice contributes $1 worth of bitcoin, Bob contributes $2 worth of bitcoin. Alice can redeem this UTXO for $1 worth of bitcoin and Bob gets the leftovers. If the price goes up, then Bob has profited. If the price goes down, he has lost a little, but Alice still has her $1. There are edge cases to worry about like what if the price dips too much, what if the oracle goes down, whats the best way to do this on lightning, etc. And there are ways of mitigating and responding to these situations. But thats the basic gist of it. 

bryan said Hey everyone! Reminder that tomorrow is the next hack session  for the Bolt Fun “AI 4 All” hackathon at ATL BitLab. 

https://meetu.ps/e/MgXRk/t1j6w/i 

Come hack in the lab with me and let’s build something cool! Note the time change. We’ve pushed the time back from 10 AM to 11 AM. I will be coming in from Nashville early tomorrow morning and straight down to the lab. Unless you have a key fob, unfortunately you won’t be able to get in before I arrive, so please be mindful of that.

Stephen announced the release of Mutiny Wallet from beta and opened to the world. Citizen 🇺🇸 asked about Synthetic USD and DLCs, and Stephen explained that it is a way to create something that resembles a dollar using a price oracle and a discrete log contract. Alice and Bob enter into a DLC together, and if the price goes up, Bob profits, and if the price goes down, Alice still has her $1. There are edge cases to consider. 

Bryan reminded everyone of the hack session for the Bolt Fun “AI 4 All” hackathon at ATL BitLab, and provided a link. He also noted the time change from 10 AM to 11 AM, and that he will be coming in from Nashville early tomorrow morning.
