Summary for 2023-07-03:
Elwood said Upcoming for Atlanta BitPlebs: https://www.meetup.com/atlanta-bitplebs/events/294569375/?isFirstPublish=true Presented by @miketwenty1 on 2023-07-03.
Stephen said Gm on 2023-07-03.
Robert said Morning on 2023-07-03.
Citizen 🇺🇸 said You gotta install the AI art generator on 2023-07-03.
Robert said Gortcha on 2023-07-03.
Stephen said On Wednesday night, we're going to be looking at the leaked Google memo "We Have No Moat" that @ClockworkKat shared with us. This is an interesting piece because it really shows how powerful open source AI models are becoming. What does this have to do with bitcoin? Well, a hackathon kicked off this past weekend called AI 4 ALL. The goal of this hackathon is to integrate bitcoin/lightning with AI applications. As such, I thought this article would be a great discussion piece to get the creative juices flowing for participating in such an event. Have a great Independence Day, and we'll see you on Wednesday. 🇺🇸 https://www.meetup.com/atlantabitdevs/events/294526783/ on 2023-07-03.

Summary for 2023-07-04:
On 2023-07-04, Bryan said anyone in the Peachtree Road Race was running that morning and Citizen 🇺🇸 said they had done it once but didn't make the 40 minute cutoff and shared a video filmed in one day on Mitchell Street in Downtown ATL (https://youtu.be/SvvJbxl4Vmk). Elwood said "Separated at birth?" and Dalton asked if Bryan won. Bryan replied that they finished, if that counted as winning, and Robert said the race got called due to lightning. Bryan said he hadn't put that together until then, but the story line was worth the exaggeration. Stephen and Jordan both wished everyone a Happy Independence Day.

Citizen 🇺🇸 asked if Discord was the only means to listen to the stream and Stephen said "Double yes". Stephen also shared a link to a blog post (https://atlantabitdevs.org/2023/07/05/are-open-source-ai-models-the-future/) and instructions for parking (https://atlantabitdevs.org/parking-instructions-for-atl-bitlab/). Jordan said "Savage" and Giii said "At red door". Antwane asked if there was any good parking near the space and Aida asked how to see the online streaming. Elwood said to park in the spaces near Alkaloid if they were free and Stephen said to tell the valet people that they were a guest going to a meeting at Alkaloid if they had to do valet. Antwane said they were currently at the door and had done valet.

So if you live nearby you’re welcome to come. Hopefully a reasonable number of people come but not so many that my people wrangling skills get overwhelmed. https://twitter.com/ndgohodl/status/1674619236562370560?s=46&t=D-ityVL3BOo9PmF6uidHKA".
