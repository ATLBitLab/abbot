Text: packetprotector recommends moving funds into cold storage if currently custodied by PrimeTrust on an affiliated app. Swan Bitcoin moved off PrimeTrust as of last week and packetprotector is not sure what he is allowed to say regarding Strike. BitGo is insured up to 250 mil per account for cold storage on their platform. Brandon asked about River and packetprotector suggested that they are Bitcoin only which is better than BitGo in his book. Nitesh ‚Çø‚ö°Ô∏è asked if the code is nice and Elwood mentioned Jonas looking for a core dev.
