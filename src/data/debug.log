The good news is that it can be added to the group and given admin privileges so that it can read messages going forward. The bad news is that it cannot read retroactively and cannot gather past messages in real time. Bryan then proceeded to describe a new protocol he created called the Motherfucker Network, which is a Layer 2 that uses trustless ZK rollups to take funds off Bitcoin, create a private place for people to buy beef jerky, and roll up all payments into an ordinal. He provided a link to a whitepaper at https://catjerky.network. Sender Stephen shared that Alex just launched a Last Pay Wins thing (https://www.lastpaywins.com/) which is a game of chicken but with Bitcoin. Stephen and Nitesh are extending liquidity to the game with their lightning nodes. Bryan then tested the bot and Stephen thanked the bot."

Elwood HODL Barbarian: DM to Atlanta BitPlebs Twitter account today from Bitcoin Bay
Bitcoin Bay (@bitcoinbaytpa): Hey, Idk if you've heard, but BitBlockBoom has been disqualified from the Bitcoin Games since they weren't a local grassroots meetup. Since we came in 2nd, the coin is coming to us. In the spirit of the games, we're going to be putting together a twitter competition BitCombine, to distribute half of the coin amongst the other finalists. We're still working on the specifics but I wanted to update y'all and make sure these are the best accounts to communicate through

Elwood HODL Barbarian: DM to Atlanta BitPlebs Twitter account today from Bitcoin Bay
Bitcoin Bay (@bitcoinbaytpa): Hey, Idk if you've heard, but BitBlockBoom has been disqualified from the Bitcoin Games since they weren't a local grassroots meetup. Since we came in 2nd, the coin is coming to us. In the spirit of the games, we're going to be putting together a twitter competition BitCombine, to distribute half of the coin amongst the other finalists. We're still working on the specifics but I wanted to update y'all and make sure these are the best accounts to communicate through
Elwood HODL Barbarian: Ill share more details as I have them
Nitesh ₿⚡️: This is very interesting: https://twitter.com/fiatjaf/status/1663356144599855105

₿en F 🚗⛓💻✈️: They are selling the ordinals I thought?
Jordan Bravo: They published a correction: this tweet clarifies that while all these inscriptions are produced by Unisat.io using Unisats single private key, they are actually owned by various Unisat users.
mononaut (@mononautical): a substack post going around at the moment claims that a single entity owns 64% of all inscriptions created since early March, paying an eye-watering 1056 BTC for the privilege its not true. https://block21m.substack.com/p/most-bitcoin-inscriptions-belong-d6d
