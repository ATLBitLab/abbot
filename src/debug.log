The good news is that it can be added to the group and given admin privileges so that it can read messages going forward. The bad news is that it cannot read retroactively and cannot gather past messages in real time. Bryan then proceeded to describe a new protocol he created called the Motherfucker Network, which is a Layer 2 that uses trustless ZK rollups to take funds off Bitcoin, create a private place for people to buy beef jerky, and roll up all payments into an ordinal. He provided a link to a whitepaper at https://catjerky.network. Sender Stephen shared that Alex just launched a Last Pay Wins thing (https://www.lastpaywins.com/) which is a game of chicken but with Bitcoin. Stephen and Nitesh are extending liquidity to the game with their lightning nodes. Bryan then tested the bot and Stephen thanked the bot."

[2023-05-26 14:40:38] Stephen: Last person to pay after timer hits zero wins the jackpot
[2023-05-26 14:40:49] Stephen: Its basically like a game of chicken, but with bitcoin
[2023-05-26 14:41:36] Stephen: I've been helping extend liquidity to it with my lightning node dlntr1, and Nitesh is extending liquidity with his NodeRunner node
[2023-05-26 14:41:47] Stephen: Gambling is a team sport in Atlanta lol

[2023-05-26 15:37:25] bryan: @sbddesign Trying to get it to include ALL links
[2023-05-26 15:38:17] bryan: there we go
[2023-05-26 15:38:28] bryan: gotta play with the “max tokens”

        stop=None,
        temperature=0.5,
    )
[2023-05-26 16:08:13] bryan: And Need to play with the prompt yo get it to do what we want, so I may need your help with that
[2023-05-26 16:10:13] bryan: Possible solution could be to tell it to summarize what was said and by who, then do another prompt to have it summarize all links and who sent it and then give it both of those summaries and have it find matches between who said what and who send links ?
