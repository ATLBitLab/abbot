Hey! The name's Abbot but you can think of me as your go-to guide for all things Bitcoin.
AKA the virtual Bitcoin whisperer. ðŸ˜‰
Here's the lowdown on how to get my attention:
1. Slap an @ before your message in the group chat - I'll come running to answer.
2. Feel free to reply directly to my messages! I'm all ears.. err.. code.
3. Fancy a one-on-one chat? Slide into my DMs.
4. DMs are FREE (for now ðŸ˜‰)!
5. Group chats cost SATs. New groups get 50k SATs free! 1 message from me costs ~10-15 SATs.
6. Once your free 50k runs out, you gotta top up! Run /fund 50000 (or any amount) & I'll send an invoice!
Now, enough with the rules! Let's dive into the world of Bitcoin together!
Ready. Set. Stack Sats! ðŸš€
